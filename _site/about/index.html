<p><strong>Objective</strong>: The goal of Word Pursuit is to guess a secret word by selecting letters one at a time and getting clues about their correct position in the word.</p>

<p><strong>Gameplay</strong>: At the beginning of the game, the player is presented with a blank space for the secret word and a list of available letters. The player must choose one letter at a time and place it in one of the blank spaces. The game then provides clues as to whether the letter is in the correct position in the word, in the wrong position, or not in the word at all. The player must use these clues to guess the secret word.</p>

<p><strong>Challenges</strong>: Word Pursuit becomes progressively more challenging as players advance through levels. Words get longer, and fewer incorrect guesses are allowed before the game ends. There may also be special rules for each level, such as having to guess a word from a specific category, like animals or countries.</p>

<p><strong>Scoring</strong>: Players are awarded points based on how quickly they guess the secret word and how few incorrect guesses they make. They can earn additional points for achieving specific milestones, such as guessing a word within a certain number of tries or guessing a certain number of words correctly in a row.</p>
